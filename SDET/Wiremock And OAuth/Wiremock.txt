Agenda:
======

1) Mocking API's

Mimics some action
Stunt double 
Test Doubles

Not a Real API
Integration Testing
Simulators --Stub and Driver
Top Down Approach --Stubs
Bottom Up Approach --Driver

Mocking API's:
===============

Fake --Replicates the exact system
Stub  --Giving you the static response
mock -- fake+stub (Dynamic Response)

1) Third Party API's
2) API is not ready for testing

InSprint Automation

Dev is Inprogress, Yet to start development

API Documentation

Development of API scripts will be started mock

Service providers --Easymock,powermock and wire mock

RestAssured:
===========
RestAssured is java library for api automation
Testing API's

C# --Rest Sharp
python -pytest

Open source
Community support
BDD style
Hamcrest --Inbuild Assertions

Steps:
=====
1) Create a Maven Project 
2) Add the below dependencies
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
			<artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
			<version>5.3.0</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.testng</groupId>
			<artifactId>testng</artifactId>
			<version>7.5</version>
		</dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.tomakehurst</groupId>
  <artifactId>wiremock-jre8</artifactId>
  <version>2.35.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

3) Make wiremock server up --https://wiremock.org/docs/download-and-installation/
Go to the path where wiremock server is downloaded and run the below command from the command prompt
java -jar wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.35.0.jar




In command prompt run the below commands

1) netstat -ano | findstr :8080
2) From the output of first command get the PID and run
taskkill /f /pid pidnumber

Wiremock

Preconditions:
==============

1) Go to the documentation of wiremock --https://wiremock.org/docs/

2) Download and install wiremock server --https://wiremock.org/docs/download-and-installation/

3) Make the wiremock server up
java -jar wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.35.0.jar

4) Add the wiremock dependency in the pom.xml file

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.tomakehurst/wiremock -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.tomakehurst</groupId>
    <artifactId>wiremock</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0-beta-10</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>


1) Stub
2) Recording in wiremock
3) Dynamic Templates

Steps for Recording:
====================

1) Access the https://wiremock.org/docs/record-playback/
2) Access -http://localhost:8080/__admin/recorder
which is the wiremock recorder
3)Add service now url
https://dev90367.service-now.com

*Assignment*

1) Create a Stub for Post call in to create Incident
Run the API request to ensure that response is displayed from 
Stub
2) Record the Get all incidents and initiate request without
Authentication after recording the template










































2) Schema validation
